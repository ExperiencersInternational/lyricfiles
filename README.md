# lyricfiles
This is a dump of synchronised LRC lyrics for anyone to download. I usually make these because there are no synchronised copies online. You can help out to this repository yourself by making a pull request to this repository by adding lyrics you've made to your favourite songs. The best place to help you synchronise lyrics is [this one](https://lrc-maker.github.io/#/editor/).

## Compatibility

I've tested external lyrics to be compatible with:
* MusicBee
* Retro Music
* Huawei Music (requires additional steps, see tutorials section)
* Xiaomi Music
* Media player bundled with Toshiba Android TVs, think its a Mediatek application

## Tutorials

### Add lyrics to music on Huawei devices using the Huawei Music application

In your internal storage or SD card, make a folder called 'Musiclrc'. Download the lyrics you want, and make sure to rename your lyrics file to the exact name of the song in your Music folder. Now, change the file extension from .lrc to .trc (this is so the lyrics are synced up). Make sure your lyrics file is in the 'Musiclrc' folder and you'll be able to play music with synchronised lyrics.

### Add lyrics to music on Xiaomi devices, MusicBee and many more pieces of software

Download the lyrics you want, and make sure to rename your lyrics file to the exact name of the song. Make sure to place your lyrics file in the same folder as your song, and it should work correctly.
