In your internal storage or SD card, make a folder called 'Musiclrc'. Download the lyrics you want, and make sure to rename your lyrics file to the exact name of the song in your Music folder.

Make sure your lyrics file is in the 'Musiclrc' folder and you'll be able to play music with syncronised lyrics.
