I didn't do the synchronised lyrics on track 6, but I've added it here with some changes, since the Dolphin Edit seems to be a clean version of the track.

My edits also include changed lyrics in the edit, for example 'PornHub' is changed to 'Pics up'.

I just massively thank Ashnikko for not changing the timings for anything though, incredibly helpful. Since I think it's needed, I have also attached the original lyrics for comparison reasons, but just note that I didn't make them, nor anyone else who has edited this repository.
