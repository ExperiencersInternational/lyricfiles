Lyrics for the entire 'The Payback' album apart from Anywhere In The World (I'll probably do that eventually, appears in the Deluxe version).

Just a quick note for I Am No One. I sourced most of the lyrics from Genius, but someone there decided not to include the entire track, and particularly at the last verse, I have to try and tell what they are saying. This is my best interpretation, but it's welcome to change.
