Just a quick note for I Am No One. I sourced most of the lyrics from Genius, but someone there decided not to include the entire track, and particularly at the last verse, I have to try and tell what they are saying. This is my best interpretation, but it's welcome to change.

On The Run is coming soon, can't do much about Lightning Touch or Dream On since they don't have lyrics at the moment.
